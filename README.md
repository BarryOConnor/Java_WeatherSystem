# Java_WeatherSystem
Second year university project in Java to simulate threaded weather sensors interacting with a server and user apps using TCP.  The application comes in 3 parts:

- a sensor app which randomly generates weather data
- a server component which the sensors and users connect to
- a user app which allows a user to log in and view information from the sensors

A demonstration video of this is available on youtube: https://youtu.be/lU0dgmYHC98
